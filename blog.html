               <b>A Web Designing course belongs to the field of Computer Science and IT. It enables students to learn various techniques, tools and programming languages in order to create and maintain web pages.
                There is an array of courses in this field ranging from certificate and Diploma courses to UG, PG and PGDM programs.
                Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website's overall functionality.

              <b>Python can be used not only for web development but also in many different fields (Artificial Intelligence,
                Deep Learning, and the Internet of Things) and in many different industries like Travel,
                Healthcare, Transportation,and Finance. Python is one of the finest open source programming languages
                and now has become the first choice among web developers worldwide. The most popular search engine
                ‘Google’ is also based on Python. This development platform offers
                 many competitive benefits to the web developers for development for an impressive website.</b>

              <b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
                For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs,
                a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript make up
                the essential building blocks of websites worldwide, with CSS controlling a page's appearance and JavaScript programming
                its functionality. You can think of the HTML document
                as providing the bones of a webpage, while CSS provides the skin, and JavaScript provides the brains.

              <b>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side
                   that allows you to make web pages interactive. Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience
                    of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one.
                   To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.JavaScript is undeniably better than Python
                    for website development for one simple reason: JS runs in the browser while Python is a backend
                    server-side language. While Python can be used in part to create a website, it can't be used alone. 
                   JavaScript is the better choice for desktop and mobile websites.</b>
